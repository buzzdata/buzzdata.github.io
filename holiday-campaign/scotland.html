        <h1>First-Footing in Scotland</h1>
        <p class="date">January 1, 2017</p>
        <p>
        Scotland is home to Hogmanay (hog-mah-NAY), a New Year’s celebration that sees neighbours visiting each other a little after midnight to be the first to offer good wishes for the new year. Traditionally, “First foots” would bring a gift of coal for the fire, coins, shortbread (mmmm!) or whisky (double mmmmm!). It is considered lucky if a tall, dark and handsome man is the first to enter your house after the new year. While December 25 tends to be a quiet time with family, Hogmanay gets loud, especially in Edinburgh where a huge all-night street party takes over the city.
