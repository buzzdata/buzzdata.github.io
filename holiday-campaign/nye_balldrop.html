          Perhaps the most famous holiday tradition in the US is the dropping of the New Year ball in Times Square, NYC. Thousands gather to watch the ball make its one-minute drop, arriving exactly at midnight – and millions watch on TV. The tradition began in 1907. The original ball was made of iron and wood; the current one is made of Waterford Crystal, weighs 11,875 pounds and is 12 feet in diameter. The ball’s flagpole rises 475 feet above the street. Bonus fact: The first time the new year was celebrated on January 1st was in Rome in 153 B.C. The month of January didn’t even exist until 700 B.C.
