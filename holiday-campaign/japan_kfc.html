        <h1>Christmas with the Colonel</h1>
        <p class="date">December 25, 2016</p>

          While it’s true that Christmas isn’t really celebrated in Japan where the new year is the most important holiday, a December 25th tradition centers on KFC. The Colonel is so popular in Japan at Christmas that KFC suggests that customers place their holiday order two months in advance! The craze began back in 1974 when KFC bosses unveiled their first Christmas meal for visiting foreigners who wanted something that (loosely!) resembled a traditional holiday dinner. As it turns out, locals embraced the Christmas dinner, and over 40 years later, the tradition continues.
