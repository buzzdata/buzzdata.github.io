        <h1>Ringing in the Year of the Rooster</h1>
        <p class="date">January 28, 2017</p>
        <p>
          Celebrated by 1/5 of the world's population, the Chinese New Year is the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. More than a billion people board planes, trains, boats, buses and cars to see family in what has been called the great new year's migration. Billions of Chinese New Year red envelopes (hong bao) containing cash are exchanged - red is considered a lucky color. Around midnight on January 28, no single hour in any other country on the planet will see as many tons of fireworks lighted as in China when the country rings in the Year of the Rooster.
