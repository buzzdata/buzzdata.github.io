          In Italy, children don’t ask Santa Claus for presents. Instead, a good old witch named Befana (Giver of Gifts) oversees the gift-giving. Traditionally, on the eve of Epiphany, parents leave out a plate of broccoli with spiced sausage and a glass of wine for Befana – who gets mighty thirsty flying around the world on her broomstick and climbing down chimneys to deliver toys, clothing and candy to children who have been well-behaved. On the morning of January 6, children scramble out of bed to see what the good witch has tucked in their stockings.
