          Those of us located in the northern hemisphere might have trouble relating to Christmas in Australia where the holiday falls during the hot summer. Forget about a white Christmas or sleigh rides through the snow! Down under, Aussies celebrate the holiday by heading to the beach for picnics, swimming and volleyball. It's common for temperatures on Christmas Day to reach nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit. At many beaches, Santa leaves the reindeer at home and arrives on a surfboard.
