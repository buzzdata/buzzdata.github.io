        <h1>Fancy Some Fruitcake?</h1>

          Celebrated in many countries in different ways and on different dates, Three Kings Day marks the adoration of the baby Jesus by the Three Kings, AKA the Three Wise Men. Their names were Melchior, Caspar and Balthazar, and if you’ve ever seen a performance of the Nativity Scene, they’re the guys who followed a star across the desert for twelve days to Bethlehem, bearing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. Hispanic communities often celebrate the holiday by serving rosca de reyes, a fruitcake in which a small statue of the baby Jesus is hidden. Whoever finds it must throw a party on Candlemas in February. In 2013, Mexican bakers whipped up and ate a 1.2 mile-long rosca made with over 43,000 eggs.
