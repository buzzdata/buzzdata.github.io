          Kwanzaa celebrates its 50th birthday this year. Starting on December 26 and lasting for 7 days, Kwanzaa is a celebration of community, family and culture. Established by Dr. Maulana Karenga in 1966 to help African Americans reconnect with their African roots, it is estimated that 18 million African Americans take part. Modeled after the first harvest celebrations in Africa, Kwanzaa is rooted in African culture, but people from all backgrounds are welcome to join in the celebrations. Over its 7 days, Kwanzaa celebrates 7 principles and 7 symbols (now count the letters in its name…).
