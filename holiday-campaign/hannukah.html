        <h1>Hanukkah, Chanukah, Hannuka</h1>
        <p class="date">Dec 24 – Jan 1, 2017</p>
        <p>Hanukkah, also called the Festival of Lights and the Feast of Dedication, celebrates Jewish triumphs. In addition to the different names, the holiday also has a variety of English spellings — thanks to the sound of the first letter in Hebrew, which cannot be rendered properly in English. A more minor religious holiday than Passover, Rosh Hashana or Yom Kippur, Hanukkah is not even mentioned in the Torah. In Israel, around 17.5 million oily doughnuts called sufganiyot are eaten during Hanukkah, commemorating the miracle of oil. We’re guessing a lot of diets start on January 2nd!
