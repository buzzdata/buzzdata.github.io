          Attention is the most precious gift any marketer can receive. We know you’re busy – especially this time of year – and we really appreciate you taking the time to view our holiday campaign.
To say thank you for your attention, and for sticking around to the end, <strong>we’re donating $5 on your behalf to the United Way.</strong> With 1,800 local United Ways in 40 countries and 2.8 million volunteers helping to improve their communities, the United Way has impacted 50 million lives and counting. The attention you pay to things has real value, and we’re proud to pay it forward and try to do some good this holiday season!
<br/><br/><strong>Keep it merry, Marketers!</strong>
